In this lab you will be using python which can be found here.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/
once you load this up send the file to execute by running helloWorld.py.

I created a program that prints hello world but also what ever else you put in it.
https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello
This is the main one I did.





I also did another problem in case this is not sufficient which was the r2.
https://open.kattis.com/problems/r2
In this one you take in two numbers and get out the mean. so you input S and R1 but you dont know what R2 is so i wrote a program that made it compute this S=(R1+R2)/2.
To do this I took R2=((S*2)-R1).
To do this I scanned in the values and then had them be within a range from -1000 - 1000.
Then I got in my values R2 and S and then did the math and returned them as 1 answer.
unfortunatly for some reason it will not allow me to add this one. But if you find this one to not meet the test you are wanting to do I will add it here.
